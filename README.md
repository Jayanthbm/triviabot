# Trivia_Bot ðŸ¤–
A bot to help answer questions on trivia apps like Loco and Brainbaazi.
This bot takes screenshot of the game on the phone and uses Google Vision API to read the questions and options.
It automates the process of googling of the answers and gives the most likely answer!
and the probable answer is displayed
**It is not 100% accurate....**




Since it is against the policy of Loco-trivia i do not encourage anyone to use this during a live game and this is purely for educational purposes.
